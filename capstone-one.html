                    <h2>What is A Jurassic Period?</h2>
                    <p>Dinosaurs lived during the Mesozoic Era, which was divided into three geologic periods between 250-65 million years ago. The Jurassic period was around 200â€“145 million years ago, right after the Triassic and before the Cretaceous period. The name Jurassic was taken from Jura Mountain, a place where the limestone strata were identified for the first time.</p>

                    <h2>How Was the Situation?</h2>
                    <p>The climate was warm and wet, thus allowing plenty of living creatures to thrive. With so many dinosaurs and vegetation growing well, most scientists agree that the Jurassic period is the golden period of dinosaurs. Some most remarkable creatures from this period are Diplodocus, Allosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Dilophosaurus, and Stegosaurus.</p>

                    <h2>How Did It Eventually End?</h2>
                    <p>The precious Jurassic period ended 145 million years ago due to a series of mass extinctions. Scientists are unsure about what the actual trigger was. Probably, it was the changes in eustatic sea level. Nonetheless, while many species were declining, many others were starting to evolve and improve. This occurence marked the transitions from Jurassic to Cretaceous period.</p>
